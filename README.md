# PowerBI_Dashboard_Project_Mobile_Sales_Data
I recently created this Sales Analytics Dashboard in Microsoft Power BI, where I explored interactive data visualizations to analyze:  ✅ Total Sales, Quantity, Transactions &amp; Avg. Unit Price  ✅ Customer Ratings Distribution  ✅ Monthly &amp; Weekly Sales Trends  ✅ Mobile Model-wise Performance  ✅ Payment Method Insights.   
This dashboard gives a 360° view of sales performance – from identifying best-selling models to understanding customer buying patterns and preferred payment methods.
